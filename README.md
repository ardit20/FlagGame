# Flag Pusher Game
This is a simple game where the goal is to push the opposing flag off the screen by expanding your own flag. 

The game can be played using a mouse and is suitable for to engage your audience during TikTok Live.

In this example I used the flag of Albania vs the flag of Albania. The flag can be changed.

## How to Play

Click on your flag to make it grow.

With each click the flag grows.

The first flag to completely disappear loses the game.
